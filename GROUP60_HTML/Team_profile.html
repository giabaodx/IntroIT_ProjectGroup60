      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">Firstly, I will introduce some information about myself. My full name is La Tran Hai Dang and my student number is s3836605. I have been living and studying in District 1 of Ho Chi Minh City for 20 years. Currently, I am a second-year student with my first semester in major that is a bachelor of information technology at RMIT Vietnam University. For me, the field of science and technology, especially information technology, has brought me the passion to learn new knowledge by the vastness of the IT world. I first encountered programming in grade 8, when it was the pascal programming language as an official subject in the school curriculum. I was intrigued by the command lines and the magic of computer algorithms. Since then, I have decided to enter the computer science class at high school and have achieved the silver medal for good students in IT. Besides, not only interested in technology but also music for example playing instruments and participating in volunteer activities are my hobbies. I hope that the time I spend studying and researching information technology will help me improve my professional knowledge and hands-on experience in the technology industry.</p>

I come from Vinh Long City, after graduating from Nguyen Binh Khiem High School, I am now studying at RMIT University. Previously, I was a student specializing in Chemistry. Instead of choosing to become a doctor or pharmacist, I followed my passion and became a member of SST (School of Science and Technology). I have a great curiosity to explore the Data Industry, and I expect to be a Data Scientist. Our team name is called '4tech', which stands for 'Four for Technology.' It is also similar to our Project Idea product's name.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">My name is Trinh Quang Minh. My student ID is s3848088. I am Vietnamese, born in Ho Chi Minh city and I’ve spent three years studying abroad in Sydney, Australia and graduated high school there. My hobbies are playing an instrument (piano and guitar), listening to music, and playing games. I like playing games and I’m curious about how they operate behind the scenes. I also like to sit on my computer doing research, so I think doing IT is suitable for me. I’ve had the basic knowledge about coding in Python 3.0+ as it was a part of the study program that I took part in.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-left w3-padding">My name is Pham Gia Nguyen, my student ID is s2819521. Ho Chi Minh city is where I was born and grew up. Currently, in 2020, I am studying Information Technology program at RMIT with specialising in web development because I want to be a full-stack developer and mobile developer. In the past, I used to have a strong passion for football and swimming because I can connect closer to my friends and I can train myself. I have won a championship in a competition in high school. I have to admit that it is the best experience and exciting during my high school lifetime. However, my passion for IT became large when I saw my big brother, a competitive programmer, solving many challenging database problems such as arrays, multidimensional arrays and matrices in an online contest every weekend. Then, I follow his path to solving problems on the Leetcode website and join a contest at the weekends.</p>
