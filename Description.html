    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>- Topic:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Due to the increased need for artificial intelligence in daily life, companies like Grab and Lazada have seen an increase in popularity worldwide. As a result, the trend of utilizing apps for a range of reasons to satisfy the requirements of the customer in various ways results in the creation of a big number of applications each with their own special capabilities. Due to the overabundance of apps available, several apps that can store more programs are being developed so users may download what they need.</h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">This project is to create a website that would become a potential tool for users/customers to utilize their smart devices. In this website, we will store and present many applications which are classified into 3 main categories: Game, Health, and Entertainment. Within the website, users can read more information about applications before making any purchasing decisions. </h5>

    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>- Motivation:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our inspiration for working on this project stems from our individual coding learning experiences. We discovered that restricting users by operating system led to restrictions on how apps could be used. Therefore, we are hoping that this project will serve as a hub where users of various operating systems can access the applications and benefits more readily than before. And because we all have different essential pieces of knowledge used to create websites, we can learn more from this perspective about how to work as a team, share our knowledge, and bring it together.</h5><br>

        <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>- Landscape:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">When deciding to choose this topic and develop, we recognised some challenges since this area has been quite popular for the past few years. There are some big competitors (Apple, Microsoft, and Google) that have made their products which are similar to our product. App Store, Microsoft Store, and Play Store have been playing an important role on most smartphones and desktop devices these days. However, we believe that we can develop a more innovative and creative product that attracts new users. One of our new unique features is the installment payment method. Adding a new payment method, we will let users decide on how they want to pay and how many payment terms they can make in case they feel uncomfortable with a one-time payment. Through thick and thin, we will give users plenty of features and options but still maintain user-friendly interfaces and designs. </h5>
