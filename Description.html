    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>- Topic:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Due to the increased need for artificial intelligence in daily life, companies like Grab and Lazada have seen an increase in popularity worldwide. As a result, the trend of utilizing apps for a range of reasons to satisfy the requirements of the customer in various ways results in the creation of a big number of applications each with their own special capabilities. Due to the overabundance of apps available, several apps that can store more programs are being developed so users may download what they need.</h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">This project is to create a website that would become a potential tool for users/customers to utilize their smart devices. In this website, we will store and present many applications which are classified into 3 main categories: Game, Health, and Entertainment. Within the website, users can read more information about applications before making any purchasing decisions. </h5>

    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>- Motivation:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our inspiration for working on this project stems from our individual coding learning experiences. We discovered that restricting users by operating system led to restrictions on how apps could be used. Therefore, we are hoping that this project will serve as a hub where users of various operating systems can access the applications and benefits more readily than before. And because we all have different essential pieces of knowledge used to create websites, we can learn more from this perspective about how to work as a team, share our knowledge, and bring it together.</h5><br>
    <br>
        <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>- Landscape:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">When deciding to choose this topic and develop, we recognised some challenges since this area has been quite popular for the past few years. There are some big competitors (Apple, Microsoft, and Google) that have made their products which are similar to our product. App Store, Microsoft Store, and Play Store have been playing an important role on most smartphones and desktop devices these days. However, we believe that we can develop a more innovative and creative product that attracts new users. One of our new unique features is the installment payment method. Adding a new payment method, we will let users decide on how they want to pay and how many payment terms they can make in case they feel uncomfortable with a one-time payment. Through thick and thin, we will give users plenty of features and options but still maintain user-friendly interfaces and designs. </h5>

<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>1. Aims:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Technology is becoming more and more popular in our society. Every cellphones and computers have their own store showing many apps that can help us solve problems with just a few touches. Specifically, our team wants to establish a website that contains a lot of sources and applications for users and create a new platform for developers due to Vietnamâ€™s lack of investment in the applicational field. Furthermore, with the trend of increasing consumption of technology products after the Covid pandemic, there would be more potential for development of our platform. Hence, the demand for using applications and websites would surge significantly that makes our website more realistic. Understanding the demand of users, our aim is to publish the App Mall website and reach users widely.</h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">First and foremost, to compete with other app store platforms, we need to push our effort to make significant differences. The installment payment method is one of our impactful features. Using this new function, we allow users to have more payment options depending on their financial situation. This will encourage users to feel more comfortable and less pressure before making a purchase. Another feature of our website is to let users log in other applications using App Mall ID besides Facebook account or Google account. As a result, our App Mall product can be confident to fairly compete with other app store platforms and reach more users day by day.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">After planning ideas for our product, we set our next goal: collaborate with other application developers and collect information. This is the most crucial step that we need to carefully cover. To collaborate with them, we need to show them our product credits and their advantages when joining our website project. If both sides have mutual credibility, our partners need to provide application information and app access rights so that we can adjust them to be compatible with our website. The more app developers we can collaborate with, the more diverse our application library is.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our last goal is the User Interface. The User Interface serves several goals for a successful online application, including managing traffic, enticing visitors, integrating smoothly with users' demands, assisting visitors in comprehending the whole website, and other technical functions. In order to present a well-designed application, we will take four steps of designing the interface: sketch, wireframe, mockup, and then prototype.</h5>
