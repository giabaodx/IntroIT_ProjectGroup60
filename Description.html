    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>- Topic:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Due to the increased need for artificial intelligence in daily life, companies like Grab and Lazada have seen an increase in popularity worldwide. As a result, the trend of utilizing apps for a range of reasons to satisfy the requirements of the customer in various ways results in the creation of a big number of applications each with their own special capabilities. Due to the overabundance of apps available, several apps that can store more programs are being developed so users may download what they need.</h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">This project is to create a website that would become a potential tool for users/customers to utilize their smart devices. In this website, we will store and present many applications which are classified into 3 main categories: Game, Health, and Entertainment. Within the website, users can read more information about applications before making any purchasing decisions. </h5>

<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px">
    <div class="w3-padding-20 w3-center" style="max-width:1000px">
    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>- Motivation:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our inspiration for working on this project stems from our individual coding learning experiences. We discovered that restricting users by operating system led to restrictions on how apps could be used. Therefore, we are hoping that this project will serve as a hub where users of various operating systems can access the applications and benefits more readily than before. And because we all have different essential pieces of knowledge used to create websites, we can learn more from this perspective about how to work as a team, share our knowledge, and bring it together.</h5><br>
    <br>
        <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>- Landscape:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">When deciding to choose this topic and develop, we recognised some challenges since this area has been quite popular for the past few years. There are some big competitors (Apple, Microsoft, and Google) that have made their products which are similar to our product. App Store, Microsoft Store, and Play Store have been playing an important role on most smartphones and desktop devices these days. However, we believe that we can develop a more innovative and creative product that attracts new users. One of our new unique features is the installment payment method. Adding a new payment method, we will let users decide on how they want to pay and how many payment terms they can make in case they feel uncomfortable with a one-time payment. Through thick and thin, we will give users plenty of features and options but still maintain user-friendly interfaces and designs. </h5>

</div>
<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>1. Aims:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Technology is becoming more and more popular in our society. Every cellphones and computers have their own store showing many apps that can help us solve problems with just a few touches. Specifically, our team wants to establish a website that contains a lot of sources and applications for users and create a new platform for developers due to Vietnam’s lack of investment in the applicational field. Furthermore, with the trend of increasing consumption of technology products after the Covid pandemic, there would be more potential for development of our platform. Hence, the demand for using applications and websites would surge significantly that makes our website more realistic. Understanding the demand of users, our aim is to publish the App Mall website and reach users widely.</h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">First and foremost, to compete with other app store platforms, we need to push our effort to make significant differences. The installment payment method is one of our impactful features. Using this new function, we allow users to have more payment options depending on their financial situation. This will encourage users to feel more comfortable and less pressure before making a purchase. Another feature of our website is to let users log in other applications using App Mall ID besides Facebook account or Google account. As a result, our App Mall product can be confident to fairly compete with other app store platforms and reach more users day by day.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">After planning ideas for our product, we set our next goal: collaborate with other application developers and collect information. This is the most crucial step that we need to carefully cover. To collaborate with them, we need to show them our product credits and their advantages when joining our website project. If both sides have mutual credibility, our partners need to provide application information and app access rights so that we can adjust them to be compatible with our website. The more app developers we can collaborate with, the more diverse our application library is.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our last goal is the User Interface. The User Interface serves several goals for a successful online application, including managing traffic, enticing visitors, integrating smoothly with users' demands, assisting visitors in comprehending the whole website, and other technical functions. In order to present a well-designed application, we will take four steps of designing the interface: sketch, wireframe, mockup, and then prototype.</h5>

    <div class="w3-padding-20 w3-center" style="max-width:1000px">
    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>2. Plans and Progress:</u></i></h2>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In the beginning, while Loc was thinking about what he wanted to accomplish for this project, he thought it would be cool to build something connected to the website system for selling apps by gaining experience with other programmes that are similar to App Store and CH play as well as Steam. The rest of the group thought that Loc's proposal was highly innovative and information technology-related, and they discussed it when he presented it to them. The whole group got together on day two and started coming up with ideas for their individual projects while sitting in a circle. The whole group discussed possible names for the project, all of which should have some bearing on the marketing of software programmes related to information technology. Khanh came up with the idea to give this project the name Appmall, and the other members of the group also agreed with this name. As a result, the word Appmall came to be connected with the product that the group created. In the beginning, the mock-ups for Appmall had just three primary functions: "Explore", "Categories", and "Entertainment", and "Help".</h5>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our team use the "Explore" area of the website as the primary and homepage for the website. The content of this section contains an introduction to Appmall as well as the various payment options that are available. In the Categories part, our team further splits into sub-sections to separate each individual application category. These sub-sections include "Game," "Health," and "entertainment" categories, among others. There are goods to be found in the "Game" area. When it comes to today's video games, there are both leading gaming applications and users have the option of choosing paid or free games depending on the attractiveness and appeal that comes with the authenticity of the game. This choice is made possible by the availability of both free and paid games. games with a high level of playability and realism will be added to the list of programmes for which users will be required to pay to acquire. The "Health" area is a section that specializes in health, health-related apps, and beauty for people. In addition, there will be applications that instruct users on physical workouts, healthy nutrition and living time.</h5>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The "<i>Beauty for People</i>" section will also be on exhibit. Users can refer to social networking entertainment applications to chat, listen to music, or watch movies depending on the needs of each individual, the applications in this section are mostly free and designed according to the main color tone of each application to ensure as entertaining as the item names. The "Entertainment" section is for entertainment. And lastly, the "Help" area, which allows customers to provide feedback to developers and learn more about our company by using the Google form tool. All user comments will be sent straight to the developer's gmail account so they can listen to it. in addition to providing a prompt response to the comments left by users.</h5>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">After completing the brainstorming session, our team spent a great deal of time deciding on the website's development tools. We have used software such as Figma and website creation tools. However, despite the effectiveness of these tools, Figma offers too much functionality and we have no experience with it. As a result, we were unable to recall all of the tool's complex functions and ran into design issues. Other tools are highly effective. Nevertheless, it is not feasible to do so online and connect with a large number of individuals, it can only be done personally. This leads to just two members of the team being able to work on the site, which hinders the team's progress.The group's members then sat down and considered other methods for accelerating the process. Bao has, thankfully, discovered a second tool that satisfies the test's speed requirements and provides excellent efficiency. After group members have discussed and seen the "Google site," the whole group is able to work together and will meet the deadline on time.</h5>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">When it came to establishing the website's layout, our team members spent two days determining how to design the website's layout and coming up with the concept that would set it apart from other websites . Ba had an ideal idea and developed a concept for the website's design, which he brought to the group and presented. The group then chose to let Bao design an application and the rest of the members based on the template of Bao  and develop independently. Thach and Bao are in charge of the "Health" part, while Loc is in charge of the "Game" area. Khanh and Thai are in charge of the "Entertainment" section. Each section will have a unique structure and organization that corresponds to its main topic.</h5>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">While working with the parts of the website, it happened that the functionality of the website will also be expanded, additional things included such as “Account” and “My Account”, in addition to the billing capabilities  also added. After giving it a lot of thought and spending a lot of time thinking about it, Bao came up with the concept that our website ought to have something that makes it stand out from other websites. After spending a lot of time thinking about it, he came up with the concept that, in comparison to other websites selling apps such as "App store" and "CH play," these app selling systems still do not have the policy and function to allow their customers to pay in installments when buying their products; this is an idea that is very good Bao presented the members of the group with his concept and explained it to them. The group came to the conclusion that the app store page may be improved by implementing a policy that allows customers to pay for things they purchase on the website in monthly installments. Khanh has been tasked with taking responsibility for each of these responsibilities. However, as a first step, it is necessary to develop a "Login" and "Register" system for consumers. This is because the customer's account is where the installment policy is applied when purchasing the application, and it is also where all the customer data is kept and ultimate security in our data system.</h5>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">When it comes to "Login" and "Register," Khanh made use of the application "AuthPro" in order to develop these functions. The software ensures that all user information will be secured inside the database system of the Appmall. In addition, "Login" or "Register" customers will be listed in the software's history, however, only those who have been given an admin account will be able to see this information. After a user signs in or creates an account, the user will be brought to the "My account" area. In this part, the user may meet all of the applications that they have bought and must be paying for in installments, along with the payment term that they have selected.</h5>
        <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>3. Roles:</u></i></h2>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Le Xuan Loc is Lead Developer, as the team's lead developer, he is accountable for the code editing for the HTML website using GitHub Desktop, Pycharm and commits it to GitHub online in the main branch for the group member to check. During the course of the project, team members will be assigned for tasks, after they finish, the project leader will add the content created by others into the coding section. However, mistakes will occur, the leader developer will revise and finish each individual's job to perfection.</h5>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Do Xuan Gia Bao and Nguyen Tu Quoc Thai are Technical Designers. Throughout the course of cooperation, there have been some technical difficulties. They will take the initiative to resolve software compatibility issues and decide whether to continue using such software to complete our project. They are also responsible for debugging code written by team members while the primary developer is preoccupied.</h5>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Nguyen Tung Bao Thach, Trinh Xuan Khanh are User Interface Designer. The aesthetic quality of our work plays a crucial impact in how individuals perceive the project. Designing the user interface for the website and the navigation bars is an exceedingly demanding process, and we must also consider and decide swiftly on the product's primary color tones. Design the user interface such that it is both straightforward and aesthetically pleasing, so that consumers who examine our goods may comprehend their goals and content.</h5>
        <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>4. Scope and Limits:</u></i></h2>

    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>5. Tool and Technologies:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">When deciding to choose this topic and develop, we recognised some challenges since this area has been quite popular for the past few years. There are some big competitors (Apple, Microsoft, and Google) that have made their products which are similar to our product. App Store, Microsoft Store, and Play Store have been playing an important role on most smartphones and desktop devices these days. However, we believe that we can develop a more innovative and creative product that attracts new users. One of our new unique features is the installment payment method.

Through thick and thin, we will give users plenty of features and options but still maintain user-friendly interfaces and designs. </h5>
    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>6. Testing:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our inspiration for working on this project stems from our individual coding learning experiences. We discovered that restricting users by operating system led to restrictions on how apps could be used. Therefore, we are hoping that this project will serve as a hub where users of various operating systems can access the applications and benefits more readily than before. And because we all have different essential pieces of knowledge used to create websites, we can learn more from this perspective about how to work as a team, share our knowledge, and bring it together.</h5><br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>7. Risks:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Larger projects have more risks. In the app store project we built, we simplified some of the risks customers encounter, such as application failure and payment issues, and we optimized the server so users can use the program without problems.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">App interfaces are often left out of new app releases. Many new apps avoid familiarity, especially for seniors. Today's interfaces must be simple, intuitive, and straightforward to help users make quick decisions. We use Figma and Adobe XD to design and optimize our application store's layout.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our program allows users to pay for the app in installments, but it will be a problem if they use it before the end of the payment term. This will be fixed by linking our app store to their bank account. We'll also need users' email addresses and phone numbers so we can notify them of their app debt.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">App store projects get a billing error if the customer has already paid for the app but the payment system says they haven't paid the full amount. In this case, the user may call the publisher's live team and report the fault; however, the user must provide a personal phone number so our development team can resolve issues.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Every project has risks, and the larger the project, the greater the risk. When we had to figure out how to choose the best software, programming language, and abilities that the team could use collectively to build a web page, there was a lot of debate. Thankfully, our team has reached its conclusion using the HTML programming language as the primary tool to use in creating the website.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">There were many suggestions made from the very first days we began working on this project to assist the team in completing the task as quickly and effectively as possible. But this leads to a lot of divergent viewpoints, making it difficult for the group to agree on a course of action. Our team initially used the Figma tool to design the website, but because the majority of the team members lacked much experience with it, the work moved more slowly than it should have. Bao suggested using Google Sites, another program, to create the website. The work that had been divided up to be done with the Figma tool was nearly finished, so the team initially didn't want to move. The group switched to using Google Sites as the primary tool to design the App Mall website, however, after Bao explained how the Google Site tool functions and the group realized that using it in accordance with the group's criteria was quick and efficient.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In addition to using Google Sites to design the App Mall website, my team also uses HTML to highlight key information on the page and write essential website content. Our team still faced numerous issues after its initial exposure to a new programming language, which caused delays in their work. If you don't link the HTML file and manage the files in a folder properly when coding HTML, it's simple to get a "file not found" error. In order for our team to work more efficiently, we all learn more about HTML.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Since our team is made up of mostly freshmen, GitHub has a user interface that is rather complex and many features that we are not fully familiar with, which can cause confusion if we create too many branches. When pulling branches, the administrator will become confused. Using so many branches also runs the risk of losing the group's files.</h5>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Team members do not always have free time for group meetings, so the times we have group meetings are mostly at midnight to ensure consistency of the project. We make the most of the time gaps and free time that our members have for team meetings and optimize each person's work efficiency.</h5>
        <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>8. Group processes and Communications:</u></i></h2>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The team leader contacts the team members to obtain their contact information in order to schedule a Microsoft Teams call. Then, use Microsoft Teams as a place to discuss and plan the problems the team should solve, and assign tasks to each member so that everyone is aware of his or her tasks. We can arrange to meet three times per week to work on the assignment, according to the availability of each group member. We organized an online group meeting via Microsoft Teams at the beginning of the week in order to divide the work among the members and schedule a face-to-face meeting for group work.</h5>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">With this face-to-face meeting, we will be able to easily assist one another with homework and make progress faster. In addition to Microsoft Teams, Google Docs is chosen as a tool to help groups store and share project-related documents and information. To ensure that the process is ongoing, each team member must provide contact information and verbally commit to providing quality results for assigned tasks by the deadline for the draft. The contribution of each individual to the group project will be assessed by peer review. </h5>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">If a team member has personal issues that cannot be resolved quickly, he or she must inform the rest of the team in order to find a solution in advance. If a team member is unable to complete his or her assigned task by the due date, he or she must inform the rest of the group of his or her plan so that everyone on the team can complete their assigned tasks with a reduced contribution from the team member.</h5>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">If we are unable to get in touch with a team member, we will act seriously. The team leader will speak with the member directly to discuss the reason he or she cannot participate in group project sessions if they are absent from the online meetings of the team and are unable to attend the offline meetings of the team too many times. This will make group work easier and without bias, if a team member doesn't do it and gets a high score.</h5>
