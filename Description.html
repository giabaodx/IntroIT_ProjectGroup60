    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>Overview:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our project is about creating a website that would become a useful tool for newcomers /beginners to the IT world. In this website, we will have these main features: Basic guidelines to Python, HTML, JAVA, C++, etc. (this part we would also have videos to demonstrate the codeline), a sharing page from other advanced coders on tips and on where to start in programming, a place where our aimed users can get a certificate from us in achieving their course. </h5><br>

    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>Motivation:</u></i></h2>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our motivation for this project comes from the personal experiences of ourselves when we first started in programming. We found that we were lost on our way to the purpose in this IT world and we were a bit struggling to understand the concepts/codes-line. So we hope that this project can be a place to help users in defining their ways in the industry and could somehow approach the lessons easier than we did in the past. And from our side of this, we get to learn more about working as a team, get to share our knowledge and combine them together as we all have different parts of required knowledge used to make the website.</h5><br>
    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>Description:</u></i></h2>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The introduction of our team Project would start with the deep meaning of our Project: 4tech. It is a combination of four elements: Academic, Sharing, New, Credit, and Qualifications. 4tech strives to advance into a contribution that users entrance to hit the books and a diverse channel of instruction supporting you in your performance and maps.</h5><br>
        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i><u>a. Academic:</u></i></h5></dd><br>
        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i>The academic part will be to play an essential role in explaining the most. At this platform, students will have more opportunity to experience, and education such as training through many lectures and the practices will be uploaded and renewed regularly of 4-Tech. Following the conversations is a comprehensive video tutorial. In the lessons, learners also can cultivate a specialized technical English vocabulary via in the learning process.</i></h5></dd><br>
        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i>- Lectures: Many programming languages including Python, Java, C, C ++, C # will be integrated into the lecturers.</i></h5></dd><br>
        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i>- Exercise: Students can test their own knowledge by completing application exercises after each new lesson.</i></h5></dd><br>
        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i>- Videos: Today, with the advent of many academic websites for programming with simple documentation tutorials but rarely detailed video tutorials. It is difficult for beginners to understand and overwhelmed when visiting these websites. Therefore, the combination of lectures with tutorial videos will be one of the useful solutions.</i></h5></dd><br>
        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i>- Vocabulary: The noted vocabulary is usually technical words; students will encounter these words in many documents or other technical articles.</i></h5></dd><br>
        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i><u>b. Sharing:</u></i></h5></dd><br>
        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i>Articles sharing knowledge and learning experiences, which are gathered from people who have been in the industry before, will be posted and archived in a separate directory. Some examples include: Sharing work experience at Google, How to conquer Python,  Experience in applying for a technical job and The opportunity of Data Science in the future.</i></h5></dd><br>
        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i>Besides, the career path is an indispensable part of the sharing page. In technology industry,  each difference direction of working will accompany the different learning and practice pathway. 4-Tech will summarise and recommend in detail about a learning path suitable for the purpose that supports students can undoubtedly determine their way of studies and careers in the future.</i></h5></dd><br>

        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i>Category news will be the highlight of the website. This feature will be continuously updated with information related to the field of technology, including AI projects, Robots, which technologies are being researched, and how the revolutions that technology results in life. This feature also allows students to refer to recruitment information for many different career opportunities and job positions in technology with job requirements and descriptions.</i></h5></dd><br>
        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i>Updating a lot of news and our current knowledge would be necessary as well as identifying the requirements of employers now; our insights, which are a vital division that brings success on the future career path, will become competent yourself..</i></h5></dd><br>

        <dd class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"><h5><i>Students will have to take the final exam relevant with the knowledge learned by many types of questions or undertake their own science and engineering projects to achieve a 4-Tech certificate, which is the reinforcement of quality of the curriculum vitae (CV) in a job interview or applying for a higher level scholarship, after completing the course.</i></h5></dd>
