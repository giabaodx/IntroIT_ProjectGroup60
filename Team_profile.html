I've spent the last 20 years residing and attending school in Ho Chi Minh City in District 12. At RMIT Vietnam University, I am now a first-year student in my first semester of a bachelor of Information Technology program. The breadth of the IT world has sparked my desire for expanding my knowledge in the disciplines of science and technology, particularly information technology. When the pascal programming language was a recognized academic topic in grade 8, that's when I first learned about programming. The mystique of computer algorithms and command lines captivated me. I gained expertise with coding languages like Python, Linux, and Java while studying IT at RMIT Vietnam University, so I want to further my skills by studying cloud technologies. I am hoping that the time I spend learning about and investigating information technology will assist me advance my professional understanding and practical expertise in the field.</p>

As I grew up, I realised that Information Technology is my strength. I have started to learn many things about science and technology since I was 14. When I turned 18, I decided to apply to study at RMIT University for the Bachelor of Information Technology. It was my dream university then. As I have studied at this university for a few months, I learned a lot more. I learned many coding languages, and how a computer works. I also spread out my connection here and made some solid friends. My expected career in the future is to become a full-stack developer, a Data Analyst, or a Cloud Engineer for big companies. I hope the time spent in this university will be worth and priceless.</p>

When I was a kid, I always said that when I grew up, I wanted to be able to programme computers and understand how they work. I find it fascinating that research on artificial intelligence suggests that robots may one day be able to assist humans in many aspects of daily life. I made the decision to attend RMIT Vietnam so that I could get a foundational understanding of computer technology. During the second semester, I was exposed to programming languages such as Python and User-centred design, and I studied operating systems such as Linux and Java. I also gained some understanding about microchips. My primary objective is to get in-depth knowledge of all of the programming languages available at RMIT Vietnam so that I may choose which language best suits my needs in the field of information technology. I have high hopes that in the not-too-distant future I will be able to increase my level of knowledge and skill, which will allow me to enter the field of information technology and bring my passion a step closer to me. In addition, it is possible that becoming competent and fluent in the language of information technology is a must.</p>

I was born in Buon Ma Thuot city, Dak Lak province and Iâ€™ve spent three years studying civil engineering in Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, District 10.  With the covid 19 pandemic, the times I stay at home and think about myself. My mind is changing and that leads me to the next field. Now, I found my passion with coding. This semester, I learned Python and HTML, which are new coding languages to me, but I like the feeling of sitting on my computer doing research, so I think this major will be my future. After all, I recognized the importance of IT in our world with Algorithms, logic that helps us solve all the problems immediately with just a few buttons. Besides, not only interested in technology but also fitness and drawing are my favor.</p>
