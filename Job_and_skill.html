Based on the results of my learning style test, the auditory learning style allowed me to easily listen and understand the opinions of the group members. I am a practical and appropriate person to solve difficult group problems in a flexible way instead of working with boring theory. Besides, with good observation and ability to communicate I will be one of the connections that help the team can work together comfortably. Also, as a result of my personality test and Myers-Briggs, I always have a positive and responsible energy in my assigned work. This is important and necessary in team work because it brings dynamism, respect, contribution, and improvement of strengths and weaknesses to achieve the goals set by the group.</p>

        <i>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i>
        <p>In general, IT staff play an important role in monitoring and maintaining the operation of computers and networks of an organization or enterprise. In the era of technology 4.0, the emergence of new technologies in everyday work requires someone to install, diagnose software and hardware failures, and resolve these technical problems.</p>
        <p>The work is as well as general knowledge about how computer systems are used and applying technical understanding relevant to computer software or hardware. For other IT students, their ideal job is usually an application developer, a website developer or one of the other specific IT fields. But for me this is considered an ideal job because it gives me an overview of a big picture of the world of technology instead of just focusing on a specific field.</p>
        <p>After consulting the Burning Glass data, I decided I would not change this ideal job because of the opportunities that this job offers me. This work provides a dynamic, comfortable and professional working environment with no sitting at the desk all day. It opens up many possibilities for developing my skills, building relationships, updating new technologies, not just software and hardware, and training my English skills.</p>
        <p>In short, this job will not bring a significant income and is not the dream job of many people. However,  IT officers are an indispensable part of any business, who helps to bring about the smooth and balanced working of a computer system. Besides, this job creates a great career opportunity in the era of industrialization and modernization today.</p>

        <dl>
        <dt>After consulting the information provided by Burning Glass Data, I still have not changed the viewpoint of my ideal Job. The following are additional analyzes for the above statement:</dt><br>
        <dd>- The Specialised Skills listed Python with the low employers' demand and without the existence of the R programming language. However, according to the information provided by the Online data science community Kaggle's annual survey, “ Python is utilized by 76.3% of respondents and R by 59.2%” . [1]. So Python and R still play a crucial role in the Data area.</dd><br>
        <dd>- Presentation skills, as well as Analytical skills, support Data scientists to demonstrate their results with other teams and customers who cannot 'read' the statistic.</dd><br>
        <dt>Although the Data Science Job was not listed as a high demand job in the Burning Burning Glass Data 2018, I  still love to do this job because of my passion for data, and I believe in the future with rapid development, the demand for employers to data also increases.</dt>

        <i>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i>
        <p>After looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed. In my views, a Software Engineer is the one who has the ability to create new advanced, innovative products to help the community in various fields of life. This job required to have a high determination and a mindset of not giving up which I have as being a Software Engineer is considered to be one of the most stressful jobs. For me, being a Software Engineer is one dream I want to have come true in the future.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, at this time of life where it is called the 4.0 ages, the age of technology, this is the time when the people want the most advanced and innovative technologies for their life. That becomes a big chance for developers to have their creativity to actually act and create products that can supply the needs for users and this is the time where different companies are trying to recruit the qualified employees to be a part of their families. Nowadays, thanks to the innovating of programming languages, they have come up with an easy high-level programming language called Python, which can be approachable by everyone at the biggest operating system (Microsoft Windows and MacOS). According to different surveys on coders of all ages, Python is easy to learn, and it can be really efficient as there are many different sources and libraries for users to work on their project. Even though in the Burning Glass data, Python is not one of the top biggest languages, these results were in March 2018 and now is August 2020, which means more than 2 years already and it is way different now.</p>
        <p>Besides that, Software Engineers are the ones who bring needs in different areas of life into their products (medical, entertainment, etc.). Without these people, it is a big loss to a company when it comes to competing in this time era. </p>

        <i>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</i>
        <p>Obviously no, there is an enormous demand for constructing and developing websites to meet human's desires. Currently, around 1.8 billion websites are created with approximately 400 million active. </p>
        <p>Although the job titles for web developers are around 381 in Australia in 2018, the number of websites are growing very fast. To be clear, it is not very reliable to use outdated-data to compare with the current jobs. There are so many web applications we use nowadays such as Facebook, Youtube, etc. Note that, for people who use computers, they preferably use a web-based platform, which is convenient to open multiple websites for doing their work and easier for searching for their likes. Therefore, seeing fewer jobs for a web developer in a country is not right as a whole.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, the decentralized web will be the next era of web development, in which user's data will be owned by themselves and not collected by the organisation or company. Thus, jobs for a web developer will be in high demand.</p>
