          <p class=" w3-justify">I had a tough time completing the assignment that was given to my group. I was experiencing a lot of strain in my role as a leader. Fortunately, all of my coworkers were highly reliable, so they completed any task I assigned to them on time and without any objections. My understanding of the HTML programming language took a while, but our group produced the interactive website on schedule. I gained further understanding of HTML and GitHub as a result of this project, which will help me in my future profession.</p>

      <p class=" w3-justify w3-col-1">This assignment is really a tough one for me. I spent hours coding the HTML website and designing App Mall. Fortunately, everyone finished their tasks on time as they were assigned. However, I think our App Mall is still not perfect as the UI is not decorated carefully. I was quite surprised that each one of our team members is good at different parts of the project. In the end, I learned a lot about how HTML works and affects UX/UI.</p>

      <p class=" w3-justify">This project has taught me how to connect with teammates in order to get along with them and become more proactive. We began planning the project on the very first day of this subject's study. However, my team discovered an issue when working on the App Mall website; we spent countless hours a day contributing HTML code ideas together. Each member of my team has their unique talents and shortcomings, yet they manage to perform their tasks on time, which impresses me greatly. I personally learnt a great deal about HTML code and user interface design from this training.</p>

      <p class=" w3-justify w3-col-1">This is one of my most challenging tasks. Project requires each person to understand and apply what they learned so that they have improved their knowledge of two programming languages HTML and Python. Therefore, I must put in a lot of effort to increase the project's quality and development. During the teamwork process, all members work extremely hard; each person has a strength in a particular area of IT, thus the project is accomplished completely. Personally, I gain more experiences about HTML code, User Interface and User Experience through this project.</p>

      <p class=" w3-justify w3-col-1">The assignment has taught me a variety of skills, but the ones we focused on most were clear communication, teamwork, and having the mindset that we should use our skills as a team rather than individually. It took me a long time to get used to learning a language, but I was able to understand it despite my struggles. The fact that each member of our team has expertise in a different area of the project caught me off guard.</p>
